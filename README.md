# K8S Admiral

K8S Admiral, or just Admiral, is a configuration management system for
Kubernetes using git-ops. Right now it is in the design stages. This repository
is intended to serve as a place to set that design before any code is written.
Configuration management is sensitive with a lot of considerations. While
feature bloat should be avoided the first version of Admiral should be complete
enough to define it's scope and be useful.
