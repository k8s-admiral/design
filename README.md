# K8S Admiral

K8S Admiral, or just Admiral, is intended to be a configuration management
system for kubernetes. Right now it is in the design stages. This repository is
inteded to serve as a place to set that design before any code is written.
Config management is sensitive with a lot of considerations. While feature bloat
should be avoided the first version of Admiral should be complete enough to
define it's scope and be useful.
